# jenkins_integration_accelerator

Purpose: This accelerator is to demonstrate how to implement DevOps Pipeline along with Git, Jenkin, Jenkinfile, Chef Cookbook, Chef Test Kitechen, and Docker.

Concerns: Is there any more efficient and secure way to pass credentials? Instead of using Jenkins UI. (Knife file? or maybe even embedded with docker, and destroy it afterward?)
